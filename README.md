Uses Tensorflow.js's [face landmark detection model](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/face-landmarks-detection).

## Detection

This tool detects when the user looks right, left, up and straight forward.

## How to use

Then, set up the camera feed needed for the detection. The `setUpCamera` method needs a `video` HTML element and, optionally, a camera device ID if you are using more than the default webcam.

## A tool that can help in conducting examination with ease
