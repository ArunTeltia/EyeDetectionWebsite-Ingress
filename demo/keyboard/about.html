        <h1>How to play</h1>
        <p>The keyboard visible on your screen is divided into 2 parts - left and right. The app requires your camera access to track your eye movements. If you look right, the right part of keyboard is selected and it also gets divided into 2 subsequent parts and the similarly if you look left, the left part of keyboard is selected and it gets divided into 2 subsequent parts. The process keeps on running until we find a single word. Repeating this process multiple times will guess a word. Watch the demo to learn more.</p>

            In online proctoring and invigilation of exams:
            We have been seeing a completely different face of life since march 2020 due to the Corona pandemic. In this new normal, we are required to conduct almost everything online and that affects the quality of examinations too much. Using unfair means in online examinations is very easy and hence, some kind of invigilation is required. Using the eye tracker, we can keep track of the eye movements of the student and make sure he/she doesnâ€™t cheat by looking anywhere else and not on the screen.
